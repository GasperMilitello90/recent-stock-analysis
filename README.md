Tech Stock Dashboard/Analysis


After building visualizations in Excel, I decided to change formats to Power Bi for a more flexible dashboard to analyze the current Bear Market(ongoing as of 7/27/2022). I used Excel to pull historical stock data from the beginning of the year to the current date. The dashboard contains closing information, market volume, and total dollar value volume of multiple tech stocks. My goal is to granulate the data for a better understanding of market trends and patterns. I included a write up detailing a small analysis of the current trends.
